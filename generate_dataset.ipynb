This helps avoid using the battery's charge to heat the cabin once you start driving. Also, limit the use of cabin heat and instead opt for seat heaters as they are more energy-efficient. Make sure to have winter tires if you're expecting snowy conditions as they provide better traction, which can indirectly help conserve energy.\n",

      "Answer: It's recommended to stick to one type of washer fluid to avoid potential issues. Some fluids contain VOCs (volatile organic compounds) for freeze protection, which might not mix well with others and could lead to streaking or smearing on your windshield. Choose a washer fluid that is ethanol-based and has proper freeze resistance suited to your climate. Mixing different types could impair the visibility through the windshield, especially in colder climates.\n",
